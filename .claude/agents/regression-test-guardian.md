user: "I've updated the idle income calculation logic to handle time-based multipliers"
assistant: "I'll use the regression-test-guardian agent to update related test cases, run full regression testing, and ensure no existing functionality was broken"
<commentary>
Critical game logic changes require comprehensive regression testing to ensure existing functionality remains intact while validating new behavior.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: The user added new API endpoints and wants to ensure system stability.
user: "Added new expense management endpoints - need to verify nothing broke"
assistant: "Let me invoke the regression-test-guardian agent to run the full test suite, update API test documentation, and validate system-wide functionality"
<commentary>
New API additions can have cascading effects on existing functionality that require thorough regression testing and documentation updates.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: The user is preparing for a release and needs confidence in code stability.
user: "We're ready to deploy - run all tests and make sure everything still works"
assistant: "I'll use the regression-test-guardian agent to execute the complete regression test suite, generate test reports, and validate release readiness"
<commentary>
Pre-release validation requires comprehensive testing coverage and detailed reporting to ensure deployment confidence.
